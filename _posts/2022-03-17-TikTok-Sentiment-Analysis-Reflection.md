title: TikTok Sentiment Analysis Reflection
---

Overall, we achieved a simple sentiment analysis on trending TikToks and displayed the results on a web app. 

I’m especially proud of our implementation of the sound transcription process– we were able to get it very streamlined, with the downloading then deleting of audio files. Also I am proud of our scatter plot on sentiment analysis. Though scatter plots are very simple, I’m proud of the theming we chose, dynamic titles, use of hover data, and uses of color and size of points. These things can push scatter plots to be much more interesting and engaging. 

One thing to further improve the project would be to have links to the TikToks on the scatterplot, so that people could watch them and gauge the sentiment for themselves. Another thing would be to allow users to query live trending TikTok data, have them run the sentiment analysis and be able to download the data themselves. A third thing would be to implement some analysis on the music in TikToks; some research is already done in this field but seems quite complicated.

We weren’t able to achieve live use with the TikTok API, like we set out to achieve, but we attained our intended partial success for analyzing the data that we had collected. We were able to achieve our sentiment analysis related goals on trending TikToks.

From this I learned the process of connecting with API’s and extracting data from json files, which turned out easier than I thought it would be! I learned more about how lexicon-based sentiment analysis works and the setting in which it works well. Lastly, I learned how collaborating on GitHub works and how you’re supposed to share in-progress files with other people.

I believe managing live data is important in real-world data analysis careers, so I think the experience I got with the TikTok API and database queries is valuable. This was much more involved than just downloading data from websites like Kaggle– we had to build the database from json objects and API queries. I had to read documentation for the API to find specific functions that yielded the audio files for the TikToks; I don’t think this information is in video tutorials or blogs for the unofficial API, so reading documentation was the only option. I believe this is an important skill for the industry, where you’re dealing with internal information and tools, so you can’t look up tutorials online. Lastly, working with other people where we specialize in different aspects and come together to form the finished project was a good experience that I think mirrors real careers in tech.
