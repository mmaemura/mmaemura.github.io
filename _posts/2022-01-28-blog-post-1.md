title: Climate Data and Plotly
---

In this blog post I will explore climate data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). I will then create interactive visualizations from this data.

The packages that I will be using today.
```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3
from plotly import express as px
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import calendar
```

# Creating a Database

### Getting and cleaning data from 'temps.csv'

First I initialize my database file, which I'll calls "temps.db" and create a connection to it, all in one line of code.
```python
conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db") #a sqlite3 connection object
```

I want to preview my data, which I have in "temps.csv", but loading that into a pandas dataframe is slow and inefficient if I just want a peek. Therefore, I'll create a dataframe iterator with a smaller 'chunksize' to just grab a managable piece of the data. This'll also be useful when filling our database with this csv.
```python
df_iter = pd.read_csv("temps.csv", chunksize = 100000)
df = df_iter.__next__()
df.head()
```

I can see this is 'wide' data, but it would be easier to work with as 'tall' data. This process involves using set_index() on the columns I don't wish to enlongate. Then using stack() and reset_index() for the 'wide' $$\rightarrow$$ 'tall' conversion.
```python
def prepare_df(df):
    """
    Given a dataframe in the structure of "temps.csv", widen the data 
    on its months and clean the column names. Also convert the 
    hundredths of degrees to degrees for temperature. Return the 
    widened dataframe.
    """
    df = df.set_index(keys=["ID", "Year"]) #the columns not to widen
    df = df.stack() #performs the 'widening'
    df = df.reset_index() #resets the data to be actual data, not indices for data points
    df = df.rename(columns = {"level_2"  : "Month" , 0 : "Temp"}) 
    #found what the previous column names were after testing
    df["Month"] = df["Month"].str[5:].astype(int) 
    #extract the text after 'VALUE' which is a number corresponding to the month
    df["Temp"]  = df["Temp"] / 100
    return(df)
```
I wrap this in a function along with other things to clean the data, like making good column names, getting the month as an int, and converting the tempuratures to everyday values.

With this function and the dataframe iterator from before, I can efficiently read my csv into my database file. 
```python
df_iter = pd.read_csv("temps.csv", chunksize = 100000)
for df in df_iter:
    df = prepare_df(df)
    df.to_sql("temperatures", conn, if_exists = "append", index = False)
```

Here's what the cleaned data looks like.
```python
df.head()
```

### Getting data about NOAA climate stations and country codes
The next steps involve grabbing csv's from the internet, reading them into pandas dataframes, then adding them to our database

First we gather data on the climate stations of the NOAA:

```python
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/noaa-ghcn/station-metadata.csv" 
#data from the internet
stations = pd.read_csv(url) 
#don't need dataframe iterators since that data isn't large
stations["FIPS 10-4"] = stations["ID"].str[0:2] 
#adding a column, which is the first two characters of another, which ends up being its country code
#country code will be useful merging later on
stations.to_sql("stations", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False) 
#adding it to our database as another table

stations.head()
```
![3stations.png](\images\3stations.png)

Second we gather data on country codes and their corresponding countries.
```python
countries_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mysociety/gaze/master/data/fips-10-4-to-iso-country-codes.csv"
#data from the internet
countries = pd.read_csv(countries_url) #small data so don't need dataframe iterator
countries.to_sql("countries", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)
#adding it to our database an another table

countries.head()
```
![4countries.png](\images\4countries.png)

Yay now our database has 3 useful files, and there exists columns to connect all the data together. To check the tables in your data base, do this:

```python
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'")
print(cursor.fetchall())
```
```
[('temperatures',), ('stations',), ('countries',)]
```

# Write a Query Function

I will create a function to query specific data from the database, using information from all 3 tables, and return the output as a pandas dataframe.

```python
def query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month): 
    """
    Given the desired country (string), starting/ending year for the 
    data (int), and a specific month (int), return a pandas dataframe 
    from an established sqlite3 connection database. The columns to 
    return are, station name, latitude and longitude of station, name 
    of country of station, year in which the reading is from, month in
    which the reading is from, and the average temperature at that
    station in that specific year and month.
    """
    
    cmd = \
    """
    SELECT S.NAME, S.LATITUDE, S.LONGITUDE, C.Name AS Country, T.Year, T.Month, T.Temp
    FROM stations S
    LEFT JOIN countries C ON S."FIPS 10-4" = C."FIPS 10-4"
    LEFT JOIN temperatures T ON S.ID = T.ID
    """
    #the non specific part of the query

    cmd += " WHERE C.Name = \"" + country + "\"" 
    cmd += " AND T.Year >= " + str(year_begin) + " AND T.Year <= " + str(year_end)
    cmd += " AND T.Month = " + str(month)
    #the specific parts on country, years, and month
    
    #pandas has a useful function to return dataframes given SQL 
    #commands and sqlite3 connections
    return pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)
```

Here's an example of the query:

```python
conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db") #open the connection
df = query_climate_database(country = "India", year_begin = 1980, 
year_end = 2020, month = 1)
conn.close() #close the connection
df.head()
```

# A Geographic Scatter Function For Yearly Temperature Increases

How does the average yearly change in temperature vary within a given country?

We will use the function from the last part, to create a function that can create interactive, geographic visualizations.

```python
def temperature_coefficient_plot(country, year_begin, year_end, month,
 min_obs, **kwargs):
    """
    Given the desired country (string), starting/ending year for the 
    data (int), a specific month (int), the required minimum amount 
    of observations per station (int), and additional keyword 
    arguments to be passed in to px.scatter_mapbox(), we will return 
    an interactive geographic visualization where you can hover points 
    on a map to see information about temperature changes at stations.
    """
    df = query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month)

    #create a df of the observation counts of each station
    counts = (df.groupby('NAME').size()).reset_index()
    #filter out the ones that are below the threshhold
    counts = counts[counts[0] > min_obs]
    
    #merge with original df to exclude observations with low
    #observations
    df = df.merge(counts, how = 'inner', on = 'NAME')
    
    #create a df to find the average yearly change per station 
    #for the time period and month
    coefs = (df.groupby(["NAME", "Month"]).apply(coef)).reset_index()
    
    #add the data to the original df by merging
    df = df.merge(coefs, how = 'left', on = ['NAME', 'Month'])
    
    #rename the columns added by merges
    df = df.rename(columns = {"0_x" : "Counts",
     "0_y" : "Estimated Yearly Increase (°C)"})
    
    #create adaptive title
    title = "Estimates of yearly increase in " + 
    calendar.month_name[month] + " for stations in " +
    country + ", years " + str(year_begin) + " - " + str(year_end)
    
    #the figure
    fig = px.scatter_mapbox(df, 
                        lat = "LATITUDE",
                        lon = "LONGITUDE", 
                        hover_name = "NAME", #main hover info
                        height = 300,
                        color = 'Estimated Yearly Increase (°C)',
                        color_continuous_midpoint = 0,
                        title = title,
                        hover_data = {"Estimated Yearly Increase (°C)" 
                        : ':.4f'}, #additional hover info
                        **kwargs)

    #adjust the plot margins and framing
    fig.update_layout(mapbox_style="carto-positron")
    fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":40,"l":0,"b":0})
    fig.show()
```

Here is the linear regression function used to find the average yearly change for the specified month and time period.
```python
def coef(data_group):
    """
    Given a (grouped) dataframe with columns "Year" and "Temp",
    output their average change in temperature by utilizing
    linear regression functions.
    """
    
    x = data_group[["Year"]]
    y = data_group["Temp"]
    LR = LinearRegression()
    LR.fit(x, y)
    return LR.coef_[0] #0th element is coefficient for slope in LR
```

Example for the Geographic Scatter Function:
```python
conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db")
color_map = px.colors.diverging.RdGy_r
temperature_coefficient_plot("India", 1980, 2020, 1, 10,
                            zoom = 2,
                            mapbox_style = "carto-positron",
                            color_continuous_scale = color_map)
conn.close()
```

# Additional Visualizations

How does the average yearly temperature vary between two countries in a specific month?

```python
def compare_two_countries(countries, year_begin, year_end, month, **kwargs):
    """
    Given the desired countries (tuple or list of length 2), starting/ending year for the 
    data (int), a specific month (int), and additional keyword 
    arguments to be passed in to px.line(), we will return 
    a faceted line plot, divided by country, over time for the average
    temperature in the specified month each year. 
    """

    #query two times, one for each country
    df1 = query_climate_database(countries[0], year_begin, year_end, month)
    df2 = query_climate_database(countries[1], year_begin, year_end, month)
    
    #concatenate dataframes on top of each other
    df = pd.concat([df1, df2], ignore_index = True)

    #group by year and country and compute their average temperature
    df = (df.groupby(["Year", "Country"])["Temp"].apply(np.mean)).reset_index()
    
    #rename temp column
    df = df.rename(columns = {"Temp" : "Temperature"})

    #create adaptive title
    title = f"{countries[0]} vs. {countries[1]} in 
    {calendar.month_name[month]}, Years {year_begin} - {year_end}
        <br> <sup> Average Temperature in °C</sup>" #adds newline and subtitle
    
    #lineplot
    fig = px.line(df, x = "Year", y = "Temperature",
                  facet_col = "Country", #what to facet on
                  facet_col_spacing = .09, #increase horizontal spacing between facets
                  title = title,
                  **kwargs)

    #change facet title to just be the country name
    fig.for_each_annotation(lambda a: 
        a.update(text=a.text.replace("Country=","")))      

    fig.show()
```
Example of the Line Plot:
```python
conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db")
compare_two_countries(("United States", "Canada"), 1990, 2010, 2,
                      template = 'plotly_dark')
conn.close()
```

What is the distribution of temperatures like for a country over time in a specific month?

```python
def boxplot_over_time(country, year_begin, year_end, month, **kwargs):
    """
    Given the desired country (string), starting/ending year for the 
    data (int), a specific month (int), and additional keyword 
    arguments to be passed in to px.box(), we will return multiple box
    plots of temperature for each year in the specified month, with added
    hover data.
    """

    #query the data base
    df = query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month)

    #rename the temp column
    df = df.rename(columns = {"Temp" : "Temperature"})
    
    #make adaptive title 
    title = f"Temperature Distribution in {country} in {calendar.month_name[month]}, Year {year_begin} - {year_end}"

    #make the box plot
    fig = px.box(df, x = "Year", y = "Temperature",
                 notched = True, #makes indents around the mean
                 title = title,
                 hover_data = ["Country", "Month"], #added hover data on the outliers

Example of the Box Plot:
```python
conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db")
boxplot_over_time("Brazil", 2000, 2005, 3, template = 'plotly_dark')
