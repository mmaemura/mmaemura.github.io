In this blog post I will...

The packages that I will be using today.
```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3
from plotly import express as px
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import calendar
```

First I create my database file, which I'll calls "temps.db" and create a connection to it, all in one line of code.
```python
conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db") #a sqlite3 connection object
```

I want to preview my data, which I have in "temps.csv", but loading that into a pandas dataframe is slow and inefficient if I just want a peek. Therefore, I'll create a dataframe iterator with a smaller 'chunksize' to just grab a managable piece of the data.
```python
df_iter = pd.read_csv("temps.csv", chunksize = 100000)
df = df_iter.__next__()
df.head()
```

```python
def prepare_df(df):
    df = df.set_index(keys=["ID", "Year"])
    df = df.stack()
    df = df.reset_index()
    df = df.rename(columns = {"level_2"  : "Month" , 0 : "Temp"})
    df["Month"] = df["Month"].str[5:].astype(int)
    df["Temp"]  = df["Temp"] / 100
    return(df)
```

```python
