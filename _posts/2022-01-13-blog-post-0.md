In this post, I will construct an interesting visualization of the Palmer Penguins dataset.

## Importing Data

```python
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"

#import the data into a pandas dataframe
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)

#select the columns we're interested in
columns = ["Species", "Island", "Delta 15 N (o/oo)", "Delta 13 C (o/oo)"]
penguins = penguins[columns]

#clean the data
#drops NA's, shorten species name, and drop out-of-format sex datapoint
penguins = penguins.dropna(subset = ["Delta 15 N (o/oo)", "Delta 13 C (o/oo)"])
penguins["Species"] = penguins["Species"].str.split().str.get(0)
penguins = penguins[penguins["Sex"] != "."]
```

## Making the Plot

```python
from plotly import express as px

#will need the species as numerical values
spec_ids = penguins.Species.map({"Adelie" : 1,
                                "Chinstrap" : 2,
                                "Gentoo" : 3})

fig = px.parallel_coordinates(penguins,
                             dimensions = ["Delta 15 N (o/oo)", #the vertical axes
                                           "Delta 13 C (o/oo)"],
                             color = spec_ids, #color by species
                             color_continuous_scale = px.colors.diverging.Tealrose, #color scale
                             color_continuous_midpoint = 2, #color scale midpoint
                             labels = {"color" : "Species"}, #change legend title
                             height = 400,
                             width = 500,
                             title = "Relationship between Nitrogen and Carbon Isotopes")

#adjusting the title
fig.update_layout(title_font_color = "firebrick",
                  title_font_size = 15)
```

Species 1 refers to Adelie Penguins, and 2 to Chinstrap, and 3 to Gentoo.

This plot allows for users to highlight specific ranges by performing mouse drags on the specific axes. 

Here, we can see pairs of isotope data for each penguin observation. We observe that the range for both isotopes for Adelies penguins is wider than the other species. Additionally, Chinstrap penguins tend to have higher values for both isotopes, and Gentoo penguins tend to have lower values than the other penguins.
